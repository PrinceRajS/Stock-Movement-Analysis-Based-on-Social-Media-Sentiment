# Stock-Movement-Analysis-Based-on-Social-Media-Sentiment

Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock price movements by analyzing sentiment data collected from the "StockMarket" subreddit on Reddit. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), this hybrid approach combines a Random Forest Classifier and an LSTM model to forecast stock trends based on user discussions and sentiment analysis.

Objective
The objective of this project is to:
Scrape stock-related discussions from Reddit to gather user-generated content.
Analyze the sentiment of these discussions and their potential correlation with stock price movements.
Train a machine learning pipeline capable of predicting whether a stock’s price is likely to move upward based on social sentiment.

Features
Reddit Data Scraping: Fetch posts and comments from specific subreddits using Reddit's API.
Text Cleaning & Preprocessing: Clean raw text data by removing stopwords, lemmatizing, and lowercasing for better NLP results.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of posts using VADER Sentiment Analyzer.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features like sentiment score, post scores, comment lengths, and timestamps.
Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest Classifier: Used to analyze feature importance and provide predictions.
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Used to capture sequential patterns in data and enhance prediction accuracy.
Evaluation: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
