This project leverages social media sentiment from Reddit to predict stock market movements. By scraping posts and comments from relevant subreddits, the project processes the text data to extract sentiment scores and other key features. A hybrid machine learning model is then trained, combining Random Forest for feature importance and LSTM for sequential pattern analysis. This innovative approach demonstrates the potential of user-generated content in forecasting stock trends, providing a foundation for future improvements and integration with multiple data sources. The project emphasizes sentiment analysis, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling to uncover insights into stock market behavior.
