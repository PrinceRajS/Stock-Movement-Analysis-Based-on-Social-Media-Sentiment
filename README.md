Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to predict stock trends using social media discussions. This project focuses on scraping data from Reddit, analyzing user-generated content for sentiment, and using these insights to forecast stock movements. Data is collected using the PRAW library, targeting posts and comments from relevant subreddits. After preprocessing steps like noise removal, stopword filtering, and text lemmatization, sentiment analysis is performed using the VADER Sentiment Analyzer to derive sentiment polarity scores.

Features such as sentiment score, post popularity, comment length, and temporal patterns are engineered to provide a robust dataset for modeling. The prediction task involves training two models: a Random Forest Classifier to evaluate feature importance and serve as a baseline, and an LSTM model to capture sequential patterns for improved accuracy. Model evaluation includes metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, demonstrating the strengths and limitations of each approach.

This project highlights the role of social media sentiment in stock market prediction and offers a foundation for integrating alternative data sources into financial analysis. Future enhancements could include expanding data collection to platforms like Twitter or Telegram and utilizing advanced NLP techniques for deeper insights.
